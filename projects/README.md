# Projects

Project instructions and links.

## Development and Environment setup

This part is **up to you**.
We have _recommendations_, but you can use whatever you like to actually _write_ 
your code.

We suggest using Docker and VSCode.

We utilize Docker to set up a virtual machine.
Our Docker image includes all necessary interpreters, compilers, and anything 
else you need to _run and compile_ your code.
See [our Docker directory](../docker/) for setup instructions.

See [our VSCode notes](../guides/vscode.md) for a recommended configuration

## Project retrieval and submission

Projects should be cloned from our GitHub.
Submitting: we may change this to Gradescope submissions.
