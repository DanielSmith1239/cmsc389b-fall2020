create input_list 100 cells allot
variable list_size 0 list_size !

( assume that list_end is initialized to the size of the list )
( assume that input_list is initialized and holds the list of ints )
( at the end, place all the values from the list that are not multiples )
(  of 5 onto the stack )
: prunearray ( -- n1 n2 n3 ... n)
( your code here )
